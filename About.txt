Quorable is a search engine for Quora, which is a question and answer site. 
I wrote a basic crawler which works on Quora's RSS feed based on the input entered by the user. 

As of August 2014, this application no longer works. This is due to the recent changes that Quora
introduced in their RSS feed URL system. 

Edit (Version 2.0): The project works just as it is intended to work.
